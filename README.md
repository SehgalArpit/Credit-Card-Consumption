Customer Spend Analysis
Overview
This project is designed to analyze and visualize customer spending behavior based on a dataset of transactions. The data includes information such as city, customer age, product type, spend amount, repayment amount, and transaction date. Through this analysis, we uncover valuable insights into customer spend patterns, repayment trends, and product preferences across different cities and demographics.

Features
City-wise Spend Analysis: Identify the city with the highest spend.
Age Group Spend Analysis: Determine which age group contributes the most to total spend.
Top Repayment Customers: List the top 10 customers based on repayment amounts.
Yearly Spend on Products: Analyze spending on various product types year by year across cities.
Data Visualizations: Visual representation of spend data across different variables.
Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

Customer: A unique identifier for each customer.
City: The city where the transaction took place.
Age: The age of the customer.
Type: The product type purchased.
Spend_Amount: The amount spent on the product.
Repayment_Amount: The amount repaid by the customer.
Date: The date of the transaction.
Analysis Summary
1. City with Maximum Spend
We calculate the city with the highest total spend using the following code:

python
Copy
max_spend_city = final_tab.groupby('City').Spend_Amount.sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(1)
2. Age Group with Maximum Spend
Customers are grouped into the following age bins:

18-31
31-43
43-55
55-67
67-79
The analysis shows that the 43-55 age group spends the most, with a total spend of ₹80,737,505.37.

3. Top 10 Customers in Terms of Repayment
Top customers who repaid the most are:

python
Copy
top_10_repayment_customers = final_tab.groupby('Customer').Repayment_Amount.sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
A60: ₹10,428,573.54
A61: ₹8,617,285.78
A44: ₹8,227,149.65
4. Yearly Spend on Products by City
We grouped data by City, Type, and Year to calculate total spend for each product type in each city over the years.

python
Copy
df8 = final_tab.groupby(['City', 'Type', 'Year']).Spend_Amount.sum().reset_index()
This analysis provides a breakdown of yearly spend trends for products like FOOD, MOVIE TICKET, AIR TICKET, and more, across various cities.

Visualizations
Visualizations can be generated using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for insightful graphics. Here's an example of plotting the yearly spend on food products across different cities:

python
Copy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Example: Plotting spend on 'FOOD' across cities by year
sns.lineplot(data=df8[df8['Type'] == 'FOOD'], x='Year', y='Spend_Amount', hue='City')
plt.title("Yearly Spend on Food Across Cities")
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Spend Amount')
plt.show()
